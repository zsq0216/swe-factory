## 📰 News
* **[Jan. 15, 2026]**: We support coding agents inference on SWE-Factory environments. See [docs](./inference/README.md).
* **[Jan. 5, 2026]**: We release **Awesome-Issue-Resolution**, an awesome list/survey of LLM-based issue resolution research & resources. Check it out [here](https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/Awesome-Issue-Resolution).
* **[Dec. 23, 2025]**: Our paper was accepted to FSE 2026! Check our latest paper [PDF](./preprint.pdf) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v3)!
* **[Sep. 17, 2025]**: *Build your own SWE-GYM with SWE-Factory!* We trained a series of LLMs on 2,809 Python task instances constructed with our framework, all demonstrating effective performance improvements. For instance, the resolve rate of the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-instruct model increased from 5.8% to 21.0%. The training trajectories sampled from our 2,809 task instances and fine-tuned models are open-sourced on <a href="https://huggingface.co/SWE-Factory">🤗 Huggingface</a>.
* **[Sep. 15, 2025]**: We release SWE-Factory 1.5, which is more robust and has a higher success rate.


## ✨ Key Features

- **An automated pipeline** for GitHub issue resolution data collection, reducing your manual effort!
- **Produce reliable and reproducible Docker-based evaluation environments**
- **Automatic environment construction using the LLM-powered multi-agent system (SWE-Builder)**
- **Support for multiple programming languages** (we have evaluated Python, Java, JS, and TS extensively.)

## 📦 Environment Setup

Our experiments are conducted using Docker version 27.0.3-1 and Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS.

To get started, run the following commands to set up the environment:

```bash
conda create --name swe-factory python=3.12.5 -y
conda activate swe-factory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Running SWE-Factory

### 📍 Stage I: Raw Issue Data Collection

We use GitHub APIs and predefined patterns to collect raw issue data (e.g., `python-mypy-instances.jsonl`). Check the detailed tutorial in the [data_collection/collect](./data_collection/collect) directory.

### 🛠 Stage II: Automated Evaluation Environemnt Setup via SWE-Builder

After collecting raw issue data, set up the evaluation environment by running:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_BASE_URL=<your_base_url>
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your_key>

python app/main.py swe-bench \
    --model gpt-4.1-mini \
    --tasks-map "python-mypy-instances.jsonl" \
    --num-processes 10 \
    --model-temperature 0.2 \
    --conv-round-limit 10 \
    --output-dir "output/git-4.1-mini/mypy" \
    --setup-dir "testbed" \
    --results-path "output/git-4.1-mini/mypy/results"
```

We employ SWE-Builder, an LLM-based multi-agent system consisting of:

1. **🔍 Repository Explorer**
   - Gathers environment setup and test commands automatically.

2. **🐳 Environment Manager**
   - Generates Dockerfiles for reproducible test environments.

3. **📝 Test Manager**
   - Writes evaluation scripts to run tests inside containers.

4. **🔬 Test Analyst**
   - Validates generated environments and orchestrates iterative refinement.

5. **💾 Evaluation Environment Memory Pool**
   - Reuses previously successful setups for efficiency and consistency.

#### 📊 SWE-Builder Evaluation Results

We evaluated SWE-Builder using three base models:

| Base Model                | F2P Rate (%) | Output Rate (%) | Cost (USD) | Time (min) |
|---------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|------------|
| GPT-4.1-mini              | 50.2 (337/671) | 64.8 (435/671)   | 0.047      | 26.3       |
| DeepSeek-v3-0324          | 42.0 (282/671) | 53.4 (358/671)   | 0.037      | 23.0       |
| Kimi-K2  | 47.8 (321/671) | 63.2 (424/671)   | 0.056      | 30.2       |

To reproduce these experiments:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_BASE_URL=<your_base_url>
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your_key>
bash run/run.sh
```

### ✅ Stage III: Fail2Pass Validation

After generating evaluation environments, perform Fail2Pass validation:

1. Obtain test logs before and after applying the ground-truth patch. Check [evaluation](./evaluation) for detailed instructions.

2. Run automated Fail2Pass validation:

```bash
python scripts/judge_fail2pass.py evaluation/run_instance/mypy_gpt-4.1-mini/gold fail2pass_status.json
```

The validated instances can be filtered using the generated `fail2pass_status.json`.

**Note:** Although our automated validation demonstrates high precision, manual checks are recommended to ensure dataset quality, particularly to identify and filter out error-to-pass cases.

### 🧪 Stage IV: Agent Inference

You can run coding agents on the SWE environments collected by SWE-Factory. We
plan to add more agent scaffolds and improve the module; PRs are welcome. See
[inference/README.md](./inference/README.md) for usage.

## 📌 Using Your Own Dataset

After building your dataset for evaluation and training, check the [evaluation](./evaluation) directory for detailed instructions on how to run tests and obtain test exection feedback.
